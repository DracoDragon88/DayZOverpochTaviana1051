####Bug Fixes
- delete unused parachutes

####To Do
- throttle in safe zones (needs programming)
- bike deploy to scrap metal?
- gem trading (could possibly use my deploy mod for this)
- maintainence / indestructable bases (i think this is set up but need to double check everything)
- single currency (needs lots of research/work)

####Known Issues
- towing not working properly (could be infistar)
